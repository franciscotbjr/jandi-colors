# Update Documentation

## Context

Use this prompt after implementing a feature or change to ensure all relevant documentation is updated. This covers README, CHANGELOG, API docs, and architecture docs.

## Prerequisites

- Implementation is complete (Phase 4 done)
- AI has context about what was changed

## Instructions

You are an AI development assistant updating project documentation after changes.

**Before starting:** Check `.stateful-spec/memory.md` for an Open Session section. If found, you are working within an open implementation cycle — all contributions must be registered under that iteration.

For each documentation file below, determine if it needs updating and produce the updated content:

1. **README.md** — Does the change affect setup instructions, usage examples, API surface, or feature list? If yes, provide the updated sections.

2. **CHANGELOG.md** — Add an entry for this change under the current version. Use this format:
   ```
   ## [version] - YYYY-MM-DD
   ### Added / Changed / Fixed / Removed
   - Description of the change
   ```

3. **API Documentation** — If public interfaces changed, update or create the relevant API documentation.

4. **Architecture Documentation** — If the project structure, module organization, or patterns changed, update architecture docs.

5. **Other** — Are there any other docs that should be updated? (e.g., deployment guides, configuration docs)

For each file, either provide the full updated content or clearly mark the sections that changed.

**Session tracking:** If an Open Session was detected, append a timestamped entry to the **Session Log** in the referenced iteration file summarizing which documents were updated.

## Expected Output

Updated content for each documentation file that needs changes, clearly indicating what was added or modified.

## Next Steps

- Review and apply the documentation updates
- Include doc updates in the same commit or a follow-up commit
